# learn
Contains all the learning tutorials or sample apps I've built while trying to learn new tech.

I'll be using the giant repo to keep track of all of my learning endeavors. It'll definitely be off the normal path of 
git for me, but it'll be helpful for the next time my computer crashes.

I'll encourage myself not to use submodules, unless I intend on pushing those larger efforts to github.
