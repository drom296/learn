"Given a list of people with their birth and death years, find the year with the highest population"

Approaches:

- counter
  - implementation
    - create a map entry for each year
    - increment each time the year comes across
  - pros:
    - dead simple to implement
  - cons:
    - might take awhile to loop through so many year values
