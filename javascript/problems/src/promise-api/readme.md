  - not as good as I hoped
  - only implemented: done(), then()
  - did it in a functional way, though a tad indirect so I don't believe I would've arrived at this implementation
- [ ] https://codefrontend.com/promises
  - pros
    - uses typescript
    - seems really clean, and the build up to final solution was awesome
    - fully tested!
  - cons
    - tests are given to you all up front, would've been better to build it out incrementally
    - final code (from the sandbox), does NOT match the code in the tutorial (messy copy+paste, and editing/reviewing to not have caught it)
