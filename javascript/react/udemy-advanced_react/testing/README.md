# My Notes
Cloned from: https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git

## setup
```
> npm install
> npm start
```

## take-aways
- uses chai-jquery to run the selectors
  - i'd prefer if it used Jest
- tests the end result, in this case: the html that ultimately renders
  - doesn't quite feel like a unit test
