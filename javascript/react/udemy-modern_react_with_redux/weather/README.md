# My Notes

## Take-aways
- use a form to provide the default behavior for submit
- uses redux-promise
  - I think I prefer redux-thunk
- seems like an earlier tutorial, so his techniques aren't as clean as his future tutorials
  - like giving each component a top-level class name (i.e. the same as the component name)
